### Comments on the grading
- The logic for random ASCII art is not correct. 
- The menu options are not clear and there is no menu options in general. 
- The bare function is inside another function, which is not correct. 

### Grade: R

### Participation Grade: U
 - If participation grade is unsatisfactory check the `NO` in the documents sections
